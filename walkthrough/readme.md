## Introduction

This masterclass guides illustrates how to use
Keptn and OpenFeature
to gain better observability and management
of your cloud-native software deployment.

> :warning:
> This has currently only been tested in cloud-based codespaces.
> Please do not try to run this locally in VSCode.
> This notice will be removed when this functionality is reliable.

> :question:
> What is a codespace?
> A codespace is a self-contained, temporary and disposable cloud-hosted environment.
> We will use it so you don't need to clutter up your system.

## Preparation

1. [Install the gh CLI tool](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) on your local machine. This is the only tool you will need locally.
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub Account
2. In your fork, go to "Code" then switch to the "Codespaces" tab and click "Create codespace on main"

![start codespaces](assets/start-codespace.png)

3. A new tab will open and codespace creation will begin.

![codespace setup](assets/codespace-setup.png)

4. When the codespace is active, you will see a VSCode user interface. All code and tools are preinstalled into this environment. You are now ready to begin.

## Create Cluster and Install Applications

1. Click the magifying glass icon in the left hand menu and perform a find and replace
  - Find: `thisthat/progressivedelivery-masterclass`
  - Replace: `YourGitHubUsername/progressivedelivery-masterclass`

![find and replace](assets/find-replace.png)

2. Click the replace icon ![replace icon](assets/replace-icon.png) and you'll see a warning (of course, your text will be different)

![replace warning](assets/replace-warning.png)

3. Commit your changes to your repository:

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "use my forked repo"
git push
```

3. In the terminal window, type: `make create`. This command will:
  - Create a new kubernetes cluster, exposing all the required ports
  - Install ArgoCD
  - Patch the ArgoCD ConfigMap so that Argo and Keptn work together to properly inform of Argo application health status
  - Add a NodePort service so we can access the Argo user interface
  - Trigger the installation of an Argo "App of Apps" to install our applications using ArgoCD. This will be explained in detail later.
  - Print the ArgoCD user interface password to the terminal

![make create](assets/make-create.png)

When the installation process is complete, you should see the Argo password (a random string of characters) and the following message:

```shell
ðŸŽ‰ Installation Complete! ðŸŽ‰
```

Copy the ArgoCD password and proceed with the next steps.

## Access Argo

1. Switch to the "Ports" tab in the terminal window. Hover over the entry for ArgoCD and click the "globe" icon
1. A new tab will open and the ArgoCD login screen will be displayed
1. Log into ArgoCD. Username is `admin` and hte password is the random string you copied before.
   If you forget the Argo password, it can be retrieved with `kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d`

## Wait for Installation

The platform stack is being installed and progress can be tracked via the `progressive-delivery-masterclass` application. This applications is an "app of apps" meaning it is an application which installs other applications in turn. The platform stack will not be ready until `progressive-delivery-masterclass` is green.

![pdm app installation](assets/pdm-argo-installing.png)

There are many applications which make up the platform. The installation will take a few moments so let's use the time to understand what's happening.

The platform is built from the following applications:

- ArgoCD
- Cert Manager
- Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit
- Grafana
- Prometheus
- Jaeger Operator (installs Jaeger)
- OpenFeature Operator (installs flagd)
- OpenTelemetry Collector

These applications are all being deployed at different times, as "bundles" or "waves", as Argo calls them.

The waves are processed in order, lowest first.

### Wave -1
- Argo configuration

### Wave 0
- Cert Manager
- Ingress NGINX

### Wave 2
- Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit
- OpenFeature Operator

### Wave 3
- Jaeger Operator
- OpenTelemetry Collector
- Prometheus
- Grafana

### Wave 4
- Feature flags configuration

### Wave 10
- Demo Application

## Wait for green

Wait until the `progressive-delivery-masterclass` application is green. This means that the stack is ready.

## Use nice URLs

Although port-forwarding is easy (it gave us access to Argo), it is more user-friendly to use "easy" URLs.

The applications on the cluster are already configured for these URLs but we need a way into the cluster to access them.

To do this, open a terminal window (or `cmd`) and run the following command on your **local machine**:

```shell
gh codespace ports forward 80:80 443:443
```

It will prompt you to pick the correct codespace. The two word, randomly generated name should match what is shown in your browser window.

![gh cli 1](assets/gh-cli-1.png)

Hit the `Enter` key and you should see a message like this:

```shell
Forwarding ports: remote 443 <=> local 443
Forwarding ports: remote 80 <=> local 80
```

![gh cli 2](assets/gh-cli-2.png)

## Use Ingresses

The "friendly URLs" are now enabled. Wherever you see the "open in new window" icon in Argo ![new window icon](assets/new-window-icon.png), clicking it will take you to that service.

![ingress demo](assets/ingress-demo.png)

Try it now on the demo app and you should see:

![demo app](assets/demo-app-1.png)

### Application Shortcuts

Here are some quick shortcuts to the important UIs:
- Demo application: `http://127.0.0.1.nip.io`
- Grafana: `http://grafana.127.0.0.1.nip.io` (username: `admin`, password: `admin`)
- Jaeger: `http://jaeger.127.0.0.1.nip.io`
- Prometheus: `http://prometheus.127.0.0.1.nip.io`

## Explanation

The system is now successfully running. If you look at the demo-application in argo you will see a few things:

1. The `demoapp` pod is runnning
1. The `demoapp` pod belongs to a deployment
1. The deployment is healthy and has a service attached and an ingress

All of this means that the application is accessible.

You will also notice a some Keptn related items:

1. A `KeptnWorkload` has been created
1. An instance of a `KeptnWorkload` (a `KeptnWorkloadInstance`) also exists
1. A `KeptnTask` entity called `post-load-test` exists
1. The `post-load-test` created a `Job` and that `Job` created a `pod`
1. A `KeptnEvaluation` entity called `post-eval-demoapp-healthy` exists

### So what is going on?

The progressive delivery stack includes the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit (KLT). This tool performs multiple functions:

1. Automatically calculating deployment DORA metrics for deployments it "manages"
1. Automatically creates OpenTelemetry traces for deployments it "manages"
1. Adds the ability to perform pre-deployment and post-deployment SLO evaluations and tasks (explained below)
1. Acts as a central on-cluster metrics cache so operators can retrieve metrics without the need to know their source and other on-cluster tools (such as HPA) can utilise these metrics in a generic way

An application is "managed" by Keptn as such:

1. The namespace of the application is annotated ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/namespace.yaml#L7))
1. 3x annotations (or labels) are added to the application. These are the Kubernetes recommended labels `part-of`, `name` and `version` ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/deployment.yaml#L16))

With these 4 annotations, KLT is able to customise the Kubernetes scheduler and thus "know" when a pod is ready to be schedule and then when a pod is successfully schedule. This is how KLT generates DORA metrics. KLT calculates the length of time each "managed" deployment takes. Later you will see these DORA metrics in Grafana.

### KeptnTasks

Another capability of KLT are pre and post deployment evaluations and tasks. These also rely on annotations and CRDs. First, let's explore `KeptnTasks`

1. Define a `KeptnTask` which is a custom piece of logic that you want to perform during the pod scheduling lifecycle ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/keptn.yaml#L1)).
    This task starts a `k6` container and executes a load test.
1. Add an annotation or label to the deployment which denotes *when* this task should occur, before pod scheduling or after pod scheduling ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/deployment.yaml#L20)).
    This configuration tells KLT that a `KeptnTask` called `load-test` should be executed after the deployment has completed.

`KeptnTask`s are executed as Kubernetes Jobs so the above configuration explains why we see the `KeptnTask`, `Job` and a `Pod` in ArgoCD.


### KeptnEvaluations

As explained previously the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit also provides a way to run SLO evaluations of metrics before and / or  after deployment.

1. Create a `KeptnMetricsProvider` which defines *where* the metric should be retrieved from ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/keptn.yaml#L15))
1. Create a `KeptnMetric` which defines *which* metric should be pulled and how often ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/keptn.yaml#L24))
1. Create a `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` to define the acceptance criteria. In other words, for a metric, what is the acceptable threshold ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/keptn.yaml#L35))
1. Add a label to the deployment to inform KLT that a given `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` should occur either before or after deployment. In this case, after (post) deployment ([see this here](../gitops/manifests/demo-application/deployment.yaml#L21))
